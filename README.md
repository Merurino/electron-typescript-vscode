# Electron TypeScript VSCode template

This project is a starter template configured to allow TypeScript development with Electron while still supporting debugging from Visual Studio Code.

# Differences from fork:

- Updated `task.json` from version `0.1.0` to `2.0.0`
- Updated electron from version `1.6.11` to `5.0.2`
- Updated typescript from version `2.4.2` to `3.5.1`

- Can't figure out why `electron .` doesn't work in the `package.json` I had to point to the main.js file to be able to run it using `npm start`
